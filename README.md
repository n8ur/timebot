# timebot.febo.com 

This is **timebot**, a RAG-assisted expert system created
for time and frequency applications, but the code should be
usable for other knowledgebases with only minor changes.

## Description

**timebot** consists of several Python programs that ingest (a) Mailman v2 mailing
list archive files in HTML format; (b) PDF files; and (c) web sites into two databases:
chromadb for similarity searches, and whoosh for full-text indexing.

A RAG server allows queries into these databases.

A chat server (built using the streamlit framework) accepts user queries, retrieves
relevant documents from the databases, and forwards the query and context to an external
LLM.

Most of this code was generated by LLMs, so I don't claim much credit for it, though
I suppose I have to accept the blame...
